Object oriented programming
=================================
1. java is a class based language.
2. java class consist 5 element.
   1. Variable
   2. Methods
   3. Constructor
   4. Blocks
   5. Inner class (Nested class)

   Example :
   class <class-name>
   {
   1. Variable
   2. Methods
   3. Blocks
   4. Blocks
   5. Inner class (Nested class)

   }
3. Variable
  a. Variable are used to store data/value.

  Example :
  int rollno = 101;
  whare 'rollno' is a variable thet stored 101 (data/value/constant)

  b. there are three type of variable in java.
  * local variable
    |- Local variable are define inside the M/C/B.
    |- Calling of local variable depend on: When M/C/B call.
    |- Memory Allocation : Stack
  * instance variable
    |- Instance variable are define inside the class but outside the Methode/constructor/Blocks
    |- Calling of instance variable depend on: object.
    |- Memory Allocation : Heap
    |-How many times memory will create : depend upon number of object, if we have tree object of a class then 3 time memory will create for single IV
  * static variable
    |- Static variable are define inside the class but outside the Methode/constructor/Blocks with prefix 'static'.
    |- Calling of static variable depend on: class.
    |- Memory Allocation : Non-Heap
    |-How many times memory will create : one time.
